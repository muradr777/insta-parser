# Insta Saved Parser // v.0.2.1

`!!` This parser made for non commercial use, just for fun, `use it for your own risk`.

# Idea

> The idea was to have my "Saved" posts literally on my computer for my personal use, without going for it every time in internet. Also I learned a lot of new things and technologies. 


*P.S. What I really liked, the layout web version of Instagram made with amazing creativity and extremely logically! It was very interesting to find the way how I can get this images out of there. That brougth me a lot of fun and experience. Thank you, Guys!*

  - Getting urls of high res versions of images you have in your collection
  - Code is very simple, you can almost see how the process runs in your chrome/mozilla developer tools
  - Process is fully automated you just need to run scripts (js in browser, py on terminal)

# New Features!

  - Downloading images to selected folder and with selected prefix
  - Even if current post isn't picture it will cause no errors
  - bash script to prepare folder structure for new content download

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Vanilla Javascript] - For parsing image urls from HTML DOM
* [Python3.8 (urllib)] - For downloading images using urls I got from Website
* [Bash] - for folder structure and some processes

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

### Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |
| GitHub | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |


### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma test
```
#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```

#### Kubernetes + Google Cloud
